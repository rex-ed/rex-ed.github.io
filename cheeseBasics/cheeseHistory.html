            <h2>A Brief History of Cheese</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
            Once upon a time there was a farmer who lived alone.
            Every morning he would wake up early to milk his cows,
            but since it was the olden days he didn't have a fridge to put the milk in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So after a while he ended up with this insane surplus of warm,
            spoiling milk that he kept in open jars around his room.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day he was sick in bed, coughing and sneezing everywhere.
            His gross, germy bacteria filled the room and started eating the old milk,
            making it clump and solidify.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he got better from the cold, the farmer, the disgusting old bachelor that he was,
            ate the hard milk anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            And thus, <em>cheese was born</em>.
