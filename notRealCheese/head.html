            It's not even close to cheese, but they called it <q>head chhese</q> 
            because it was the only name gross enough for this abomination of a food.

            It's chopped up little peices of a <strong>pig's head</strong> that we normally wouldn't eat
            <em>(for good reason)</em> that are then boiled and set in aspic jelly.

        <p>
            That's right, its a loaf of jellied pig head.
